## Device Parameters

### Deadline: 7/11/2019 23:59

Please check [evaluation.md](evaluation.md) for other details and evaluation criteria about the project. Open a **private repository**, which you will put all your work into. Please add me(/ozank), Furkan(/furkankarakaya) or GÃ¶khan(/gkhnckl) as a collaborator.

**1) Diode parameters**<br />
 **a)** Define the 10 most important power diode characteristics with their symbol and meanings. Which five of them are the most important parameters?
 <br/>
 [Example: I<sub>ave</sub> is the diode forward average current, defined under nominal operating conditions (say 75C if it is defined so), and it signifies...) ].<br />

**b)** Select diodes with around 5A, 50A, and 500A current ratings. (at most 10 different types/samples for each current rating, considering different speed, different voltage rating, different material type, i.e., Si, SiC, etc.).

Hint: You can search devices through Digikey, Mouser, Farnell etc. or through the webpages of manufacturers such as Infineon, Semikron, IXYS, Fairchild, International Rectifier, Microsemi, Mitsubishi, Fuji, Toshiba, ABB, ST, Cree..<br />

**c)** By referencing the selected diodes in part (b), comment on the trade-offs of the diode parameters. 
 <br/>
[Example: Select two diodes with same current and different voltage ratings. Put these two in a small table and compare the effect of varying voltage on other diode parameters.]


**2) Thyristor parameters**<br />
Repeat (1) for power thyristors with 50A, 500A, 2000A.

**3)** How much time did you spend for this homework? (Bonus)
