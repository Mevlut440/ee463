# EE 463 Hardware Project

## AC to DC Motor Drive

### Deadline: TBA (After the finals)


In this project you are required to make a controlled rectifier that will be used to drive a DC Motor.

 - Input: 3 Phase, or 1 Phase AC Grid Supply
 - Output: Adjustable DC Output

You are free to choose any topology such as (but not limited to):

 - 3-Phase Thyristor Rectifier
 - 1-Phase Thyristor Rectifier
 - Diode Rectifier + Buck Converter

### Specs:

You are required to drive the following motor-generator sets:

We measured the motor's parameters as follows:

 - Armature Winding: 28 立, 13.3 mH
 - Series Winding: 65 m立, 260 uH
 - Shunt Winding: 8.26 k立, 6.4 H
 - [Interpoles](https://www.quora.com/Electrical-Machines-What-do-interpoles-do-in-DC-motors) Winding: 0.8 立, 5.8 mH

I believe the most sensible way of connection is shunt-excited, however you are free to use any other connections (series, compound etc) if required.

### Project Steps:
