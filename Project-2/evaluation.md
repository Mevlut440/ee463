## Guideline for Project #2

Here are the important points for Project #2

- You will complete the project in pairs. 
- You will be assigned a private GitHub repo with your project partner. Each partner is required to contribute to the work.
- This project is to be completed using MATLAB Simulink (I strongly recommend to use 2016 version for compatibility issues).
- At the end of the project, you are required to submit a project report (in PDF) as well as your simulation files.
- Reports will be checked using Turnitin, and copying will not be tolerated.
- No reports and commits will be accepted after the deadline.

## Evaluation

The project will be evaluated using the following guideline:

**Number of Commits:20%:** The number of edits of your project files as seen from the contributors list. For example, if you start making your project in the last few days, you’ll get no credit. If you start early and continue editing your files, you’ll get full credit. The projects are time consuming, so this is a way to encourage you to start early and work regularly. Note that, each student will be evaluated separately according to personal commit number.

**Report Quality:15%:** Text explaining your design decisions, quality of your figures, citing relevant studies and your conclusion section.

**Technical Level:65%:** The detail level of your simulations and your conclusions.

## Number of Commits:

In this project the minimum expected number of commits on different days is 3. Each days you made at least one commit is 5 points (saturating at 15 points).  The following rules apply:

- Each student will be evaluated personally. So please make sure each team member contributes.

- Your commit has to be a meaningful, and considerable amount of change has to be made compared to the previous version. For example, just changing a few words in your report is not a meaningful commit.

- Number of days that you committed will be evaluated by common sense. For example, a commit at 23:58 and another commit at 00:02 will still count as one.

- Do not try to find a workaround. Just spend time on your project, and improve your models regularly and it should be fine.

You'll get 5 points from the content of your commit messages. You are supposed to write clear and explanatory commit messages, listing what  specific improvements that you made in that version. Please have a look at the following links:

## Report Quality:

You report quality will be evaluated using the following criteria:

- The report has a separate title page (2pts)
- The report has an introduction section that briefly explains the content and the aims of the report (2pts)
- The report organized properly with clear sections and subsections (2pts)
- All figures and tables have proper captions (3pts)
- The graphs have proper axes labels and font size of labels is adequate (3pts)
- No grammar/spelling errors and very well-written report (hint: use spell-check) (3pts)

## Technical Level: TBA

Following grades will be applied for the technical parts:

- Q1: 5pts
- Q2:
    - 2.1: 5 pts
    - 2.2: 10 pts
    - 2.3: 10 pts
    - 2.4: 5 pts
    - 2.5: 5 pts
- Q3:
    - 3.1: 5pts
    - 3.2: 10pts
    - 3.3: 10pts
